## NDG is an ongoing project aim at investigating mechanisms underlying the memory enhancments associated with cognitive reappraisal success and failure.
##### Open science framework: https://osf.io/8jh7r/.

##### What did i do?
* This project was aimed at investigating potential mechanisms underlying emotional memory benefits that have been found for emotion regulation success and failure.
##### Main findings:
* Ongoing.

##### Task overview:
* In this task, participants completed a encoding and recognition task seperated by 24 hours. During encoding participants were presented with scenes that were created by placing negative (e.g., bear) and neutral objects (e.g., deer) onto plausible neutral backgrounds (e.g., forest). Importantly, participants were instructed to either decrease their emotions by reinterpreting the details or the emotional event or to let their emotions unfolding naturally and view the scenes. Following the scenes, participants also rated if they were successful at generating a reinterpretation (decrease only trials) and made emotional arousal ratings.
* For the recognition test, old scenes presented during the encoding task were decomposed into their objects and backgrounds and presented individually intermixed with new (lure/foil) objects and backgrounds.    <p align = "center"> <img src="https://github.com/nickwyeh/ndg_emto/blob/main/figures/task_figure.png"  width="800"> </p> 


 ##### Scripts and data:
* The scripts directory contains a stimulation power analysis (R), data processing (R and Python; organize, quality control, analyses) and plotting (R; barplots and raincloud plots) scripts. 
* The data directory structure is similiar to `ND2`, see Directory Structure Overview section for [additional details](https://github.com/nickwyeh/ND2).
