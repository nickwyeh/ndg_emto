## NDG is an ongoing project aim at investigating mechanisms underlying the memory enhancments associated with cognitive reappraisal success and failure.
##### Open science framework: https://osf.io/8jh7r/.

##### What did i do?
* This study examines the emotional and memory outcomes associated with emotion regulation success and failure. In particular, I focus on cognitive reappraisal a commonly used emotion regulation strategy that involves reinterpreting the meaning of an emotional event to alter its impact. My prior work has found emotional benefits associated with cognitive reappraisal success and detrimental emotional outcomes when individuals fail to reinterpret an emotional event. Interestingly, cognitive reappraisal success and failure have been associated with memory enhancements, but it is unclear if same of different processes are supporting the memory enhancments. Therefore, this project aimed to investigate potential mechanisms (e.g., elaboration, emotional arousal) underlying the memory benefits linked with reappraisal success and failure.
##### Main findings:
* Data collection is still underway as of 4/1/22.

##### Task overview:
* In this task, participants completed a encoding and recognition task seperated by 24 hours. During encoding participants were presented with scenes that were created by placing negative (e.g., bear) and neutral objects (e.g., deer) onto plausible neutral backgrounds (e.g., forest). Importantly, participants were instructed to either decrease their emotions by reinterpreting the details of the emotional event (cognitive reappraisal) or to let their emotions unfolding naturally and view the scenes (unrelated control condition). Following the scenes, participants also rated if they were successful at generating a reinterpretation (decrease only trials) and made emotional arousal ratings.
* For the recognition test, old scenes presented during the encoding task were decomposed into their objects and backgrounds and presented individually intermixed with new (lure/foil) objects and backgrounds.    <p align = "center"> <img src="https://github.com/nickwyeh/ndg_emto/blob/main/figures/task_figure.png"  width="800"> </p> 


 ##### Scripts and data:
* The scripts directory contains a stimulation power analysis (R), data processing (R and Python; organize, quality control, analyses) and plotting (R; barplots and raincloud plots) scripts. 
* The data directory structure is similiar to `ND2`, see Directory Structure Overview section for [additional details](https://github.com/nickwyeh/ND2).
